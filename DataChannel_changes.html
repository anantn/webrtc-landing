<h1>WebRTC DataChannel API/protocol changes have landed</h1>
<table><tr><td><b>Update 2013/4/9:</b><br>
<blockquote>An incompatible change to fix a bug in the major update from 4/2 landed on
mozilla-central (Nightly) and will be in the 2013/4/10 build.  This means
that builds from before that change and after it will not be able to talk
successfully, except perhaps if both protocol and label are empty.  The
changes landed on Aurora at the same time, but likely were incorporated
into any builds for 4/9 and after.<p>
We apologize, but because of the bug it was impossible to avoid making an
incompatible change to fix it, and we didn't want the protocol to carry a
quirk forever.  We hope to avoid any future incompatible changes.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

In landings for the 2013/4/2 Nightly and for Aurora 22a1, both the API and
the wireline protocol for WebRTC have changed in an incompatible manner.
You will have to revise your code, and also browsers from before the change
(including FF21 Beta) will not be able to talk to browsers built on code
after the change

The changes landed virtually in-sync with the FF22->FF23 change for
Nightly, and will be in the first FF22 Aurora build.

Here are the changes:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>The wireline protocol changed from a 3-way handshake to 1-way (declarative).  (See <a
    href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol-04">draft-jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol-04</a>.)<br>
     This means that implementations cannot talk across the change (and for
     other reasons as well). FF22 Aurora and FF23 support the new
     protocol.</li>
<li>To use DataChannels, you must now call pc.createDataChannel() once
    <b>before</b> calling pc.createOffer(), to inform the RTCPeerConnection
    you want to use DataChannels.  You can make more calls to
    createDataChannel() anytime you want.<br>In later releases, we'll support
    re-negotation of connections and allow the first createDataChannel() to
    occur after createOffer (it will trigger a negotiationneeded
    event).</li>
<li>connectDataConnection() is being removed and now has no effect.  I'll
    try to remove it ASAP so it can be used as a flag to which side of the
    change a browser is on.</li>
<li>ondatachannel now takes an event instead of a raw channel.<br>This means
    that you should use:
<pre>function newchannel(event) { let channel = event.channel; ...; }</pre></li>
<li>There may be naming changes to fields in the dictionary.  See the
    dictionary and the thread following <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/mid/5158F0FC.3070104@jesup.org">this
    message</a> on the public-webrtc list.  The dictionary is detailed
    there, including changes to support pre-defined/externally-negotiated channels.</li>
</ol>

For reference, here is the current dictionary we're using.  Note that
'protocol' (if used!) is expected to be an IANA-registered string to enable
different applications to talk, and to help even two instances of the same
application as to the binary format of the data on a newly created channel
that arrives via onDataChannel.

<pre>
/* If either maxRetransmitTime or maxRetransmitNum are set, it's
   unreliable, else it's a reliable channel.  If both are set it's an
   error.  outOfOrderAllowed can be used with any type of channel.  The
   equivalent of UDP is { outOfOrderAllowed: true, maxRetransmitNum: 0 }.
   The TCP equivalent is {}.

   preset is set to true if the channel is being externally negotiated, and
   no wireline OpenRequest message should be sent.  If preset is true, stream
   can be optionally used to set a specific SCTP stream to use.  If it's
   not set but preset is true, then the application should read the 'stream'
   attribute from the returned DataChannel after onopen and convey it to the
   other end to pass in via the DataChannelInit dictionary.
 */

dictionary DataChannelInit {
  boolean outOfOrderAllowed;
  unsigned short maxRetransmitTime;
  unsigned short maxRetransmitNum;
  DOMString protocol;
  boolean preset;
  unsigned short stream;
};
</pre>
And I added to the DataChannel object webidl:
<pre>
  readonly attribute DOMString protocol;
  /* the 'stream' attribute is not valid until after onopen has fired */
  readonly attribute unsigned short stream;
</pre>
